# 👋 Hi, I'm Kevin Zhang

I'm a hardware/software engineer at Rocktech, focusing on embedded Android/Linux SBCs and industrial display systems. My work bridges custom hardware design, Linux BSP development, and display interface integration (MIPI, LVDS, RGB).

---

## 🧠 What I Do

At Rocktech, we design and manufacture:

- Custom **Single Board Computers (SBCs)** based on Rockchip SoCs (e.g., PX30, RK3566)
- **High-brightness TFT LCD displays** for industrial and automotive use
- **Embedded HMI panels** running Android/Linux
- Optimized **device trees** and **panel drivers** for display bring-up

I'm especially experienced in early-stage prototyping, creating flying-wire adapter boards to quickly validate displays on target SoCs.
