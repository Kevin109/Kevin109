# 👋 Hi, I'm Kevin Zhang

I'm a hardware/software engineer at Rocktech, focusing on embedded Android/Linux SBCs and industrial display systems.

We design and manufacture custom single board computers (SBCs), HMI panels, and high-brightness TFT LCD modules for industrial, automotive, and IoT applications.
